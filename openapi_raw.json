The empty equipment has been released to the shipper. The `Booking` is in state `CONFIRMED`.\n\n## Postcondition\nThe provider has received the `Shipping Instructions`.\n\nThe consumer will receive a `202` (Accepted) if the payload schema validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.\n\n## Flow for the `202` (Accepted) response\nThe following occurs when a provider receives a `Shipping Instructions`:\n1. The payload (`Shipping Instructions`) is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.\n\n   **The process stops here!**\n2. The payload is schema-valid which means:\n    - all required properties are provided.\n    - all values provided have correct data type.\n\n   A `shippingInstructionsReference` (as a reference to the `Shipping Instructions`) is created and linked to the payload in the provider system.\n  \n   **For the rest of this description and in all examples the value `si-123` will be used as `shippingInstructionsReference`**\n\n3.

This endPoint corresponds with **UseCase 3 - Submit updated Shipping Instructions**\n\n### Precondition\nIn order to update a `Shipping Instructions`, the status of the `Shipping Instructions` needs to be in state:\n\n- `RECEIVED` in case the consumer has updated information for the `Shipping Instructions`\n- `PENDING_UPDATE` in case the provider has requested the consumer to update the `Shipping Instructions` (a result of **UseCase 2 - Request to update Shipping Instructions**)\n\nThe status of `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` can be anything.\n\n## Postcondition\nThe provider has received an update to the `Shipping Instructions` (**UseCase 3 - Submit updated Shipping Instructions**). In case this is the first update to the `Shipping Instructions` the update will be called the `Updated Shipping Instructions`. If this is a subsequent update to the `Shipping Instructions` - the update will update the `Updated Shipping Instructions`. In both cases the `updatedShippingInstructionStatus` will be set to `UPDATE_RECEIVED`.\n\nThe `Updated Shipping Instructions` and the \"original\" `Shipping Instructions` **co-exist** until a new update is submitted by the consumer (via **UseCase 3: Submit updated Shipping Instructions**) in which case the new update replaces the existing. Or until the provider requests an update (sets the `shippingInstructionsStatus='PENDING_UPDATE'` via **UseCase 2: Request to update Shipping Instructions**). The `Updated Shipping Instructions` always represents the latest version of an update received by the provider.\n\nThe consumer will receive a `202` (Accepted) if the payload schema-validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.\n\n## Flow for the `202` (Accepted) response\nThe following occurs when a provider receives an **update** to a `Shipping Instructions`\n1. The payload (`Updated Shipping Instructions`) is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.\n\n   **The process stops here!**\n2. The payload is schema-valid which means:\n    - all required properties are provided\n    - all values provided have correct data type.\n3. An empty response is returned and the consumer now awaits further processing by the provider.\n\nFor `PUT` `Shipping Instructions` the process ends here. The `Shipping Instructions`:\n  - is now accepted by the provider system\n  - the status of the `Shipping Instructions` is unchanged\n  - a `202` (Accepted) response is sent with an empty payload\n  - awaits further processing by the provider\n\nThe provider will now start asynchronous processing.
